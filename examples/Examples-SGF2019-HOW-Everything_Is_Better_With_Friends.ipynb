    "Type the following code into the cell labelled `[ ]:` immediately below, and then run that cell using Shift-Enter:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "from IPython.display import HTML\n",
    "sas_code_fragment = 'proc means data=sashelp.%s; run;'\n",
    "for dsn in ['fish','iris']:\n",
    "    display(HTML(sas.submit(sas_code_fragment%dsn)['LST']))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "1. A string object named `sas_code_fragment` is created with templating placeholder `%s`, which will be filled using other strings in subsequent uses of `sas_code_fragment`.\n",
    "2. The output of PROC MEANS applied to SAS datasets `sashelp.fish` and `sashelp.iris` is then displayed by extracting the results output from SAS session code submissions and rendering their HTML.\n",
    "3. The `sas` object represents a connection to a SAS session and was created when a previous cell was run. Here, `sas` calls its `submit` method for each value of the for-loop indexing variable `dsn`, and the `%s` portion of `sas_code_fragment` is replaced by the value of `dsn`. In other words, the following SAS code is submitted to the SAS kernel:\n",
    "```\n",
    "proc means data=sashelp.fish; run; \n",
    "proc means data=sashelp.iris; run; \n",
    "```\n",
    "4. The same outcome could also be achieved with the following SAS macro code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "%macro loop(); \n",
    "        %let dsn_list = fish iris;\n",
    "        %do i = 1 %to 2; \n",
    "            %let dsn = %scan(&dsn_list.,&i.);\n",
    "            proc means data=sashelp.&dsn.;\n",
    "            run; \n",
    "        %end;\n",
    "%mend; \n",
    "%loop()\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, note the following differences:\n",
    "  * Python allows us to concisely repeat an arbitrary block of code by iterating over a list using a for-loop. In other words, the body of the for-loop (meaning everything indented underneath it, since Python uses indentation to determine scope) is repeated for each string in the list `['fish','iris']`.\n",
    "  * The SAS macro facility only provides do-loops based on index variables (the macro variable `i` above), so clever tricks like implicitly defined arrays (macro variable `dsn_list` above) need to be used together with functions like `%scan` to extract a sequence of values."
